Monocat is a React Native app targeted at toddlers and preschool-aged children that are interested in creating things on the computer, but have yet to develop adequate reading skills for school-aged programs like Scratch Jr.

I have a 4 year-old daughter that insists she'll build robots one day, and that she wants to work and earn monies like I do. I also have a soon-to-be 2 year old son who's obsessed with cause and effect, as well as drawing on everything. I wanted to make something to help keep both of them interested in computer-related STEM projects without getting overwhelmed by how difficult some of the most basic lessons in programming can be at such a young age. That's why the main focus of this project is to create a device-agnostic, IDE-like user experience focused on seeing results fast and having fun!

### Planned Features:
* Create, save and open multiple projects
* A code and style file per project
* A storybook-like help modal for each feature that will verbally explain how to use the feature.
* A visual drag-and-drop editor ux for Kids Who Can't Read Good
